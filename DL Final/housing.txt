prediction problem by Linear regression using Deep Neural network. Use Boston House price
predictiondataset. (This is my Deep Learning practical. Ill give you code snippets for its solution, give me its explaination in simple language)

ChatGPT
Sure, I can help with that! Linear regression using a deep neural network might sound a bit confusing at first, but essentially, it's using a neural network to perform a linear regression task. Here's how you can approach it:

Loading the Dataset: First, you need to load the Boston Housing dataset. This dataset contains information about various features of houses in Boston and their corresponding prices.
Preprocessing the Data: Before feeding the data into the neural network, you'll typically preprocess it. This might involve scaling the features to a similar range, handling missing values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Building the Neural Network: Even though it's a linear regression task, you'll use a neural network for flexibility and scalability. In this case, your neural network will have an input layer with neurons equal to the number of features in your dataset, and a single output neuron for the predicted price.
Training the Model: You'll train the neural network using the training data. During training, the network learns to adjust its weights and biases to minimize the difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices in the training set.
Evaluating the Model: Once trained, you'll evaluate the performance of your model using the testing data. This involves calculating metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (

Great, you've loaded the necessary libraries and the Boston Housing dataset. Let's break down what each part of the code does:

Importing Libraries: You've imported the required libraries for data manipulation, data splitting, data preprocessing, building the neural network, and visualization.
Loading the Dataset: You've loaded the Boston Housing dataset using Pandas read_csv() function. This dataset contains various features of houses in Boston and their corresponding prices. df.head(n=10) shows the first 10 rows of the dataset for a quick overview.
Now, let's move on to preprocessing the data, building the neural network, training it, and evaluating its performance.

name 'input_shape' is not defined
ChatGPT
It seems like we haven't defined the input shape for the neural network yet. Let's do that. In our case, the number of neurons in the input layer should be equal to the number of features in our dataset. Here's how you can define the input shape:

python
Copy code
# Extracting features and target variable
X = df.drop('medv', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['medv']  # Target variable

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature Scaling
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

# Building the Neural Network
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(1, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='linear'))

# Compiling the Neural Network
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Training the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=100, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Plotting training and validation loss
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
In this snippet:

We extract features X and the target variable y from the dataset.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Perform feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Build the neural network using Sequential model and add a dense layer with 1 neuron (output) and an input shape equal to the number of features.
Compile the model with Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
Train the model using training data.
Finally, plot the training and validation loss over epochs.

# test train split dataset
X = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'medv'].values  #or X = df.loc[:,['lstat','ptratio','rm]]
y = df.loc[:, df.columns == 'medv'].values  #or y = df.loc[:,'medv']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.22, random_state=402)
ChatGPT
Got it. You've split the dataset into training and testing sets using a test size of 22% and a random state of 402.

The code you provided accomplishes the following:

X and y Extraction: X contains all the feature columns except for the target column 'medv', while y contains only the target column 'medv'.
Train-Test Split: The train_test_split function is used to split the data into training and testing sets. X_train and y_train represent the features and target variable for training, while X_test and y_test represent the features and target variable for testing.
Parameters: The test_size parameter specifies the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split, and random_state is set for reproducibility.
This split allows you to train the model on a portion of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.

# Normalizing Training and Testing Data Set
scaler = StandardScaler() #standardise (Z-score normalization => mean = 0 and Std = 1)
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
ChatGPT
Perfect, you're normalizing the training and testing datasets using standardization (Z-score normalization). This process ensures that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Here's what each line of the code does:

StandardScaler Initialization: You create a StandardScaler object named scaler.
Fit on Training Data: You fit the scaler on the training data (X_train). This calculates the mean and standard deviation for each feature in the training set.
Transform Training and Testing Data: You transform (standardize) both the training and testing datasets using the parameters (mean and standard deviation) calculated from the training set. This ensures that both datasets are scaled in the same way.
By normalizing the data, you ensure that each feature contributes equally to the model training process, preventing features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.

# Adam optimizer dynamically adjusts the learning rates for individual parameters in a neural network based on the history of gradients. This adaptive learning rate strategy helps improve the efficiency and robustness of the optimization process during training.

model = Sequential(layers=[Dense(128, input_shape=(13, ), activation='relu', name='dense_1'),Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_2'),Dense(32, input_shape=(13, ), activation='relu', name='dense_3'),Dense(16, input_shape=(13, ), activation='relu', name='dense_4'),Dense(1, activation='linear', name='dense_output')])


# model.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(13, ), activation='relu', name='dense_1'))
# model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_2'))
# model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear', name='dense_output'))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse',metrics=['mae'])
model.summary()
ChatGPT
You've constructed a neural network model with multiple layers using the Keras Sequential API. Let's go through the code and understand what each part does:

Model Definition: You've defined a Sequential model by specifying the layers sequentially. Here's a breakdown of each layer:
Input Layer (Dense): The first layer (dense_1) has 128 neurons and an input shape of (13,), which corresponds to the number of features in your dataset. It uses the ReLU activation function.
Hidden Layers (Dense): You have three hidden layers (dense_2, dense_3, dense_4) with 64, 32, and 16 neurons, respectively, all using the ReLU activation function.
Output Layer (Dense): The output layer (dense_output) has 1 neuron for predicting the target variable (housing price) and uses the linear activation function.
Note: The input shape is specified only in the first layer, and subsequent layers automatically infer their input shapes from the output shape of the previous layer.
Model Compilation: After defining the model architecture, you compile it using the Adam optimizer ('adam') and specify the loss function as Mean Squared Error ('mse'). Additionally, you've included Mean Absolute Error ('mae') as a metric to monitor during training.
Model Summary: You've printed the summary of the model, which provides a high-level overview of the model architecture, including the number of parameters in each layer and the total number of parameters in the model.
Overall, this model consists of an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. The ReLU activation function is used in the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity, and the linear activation function is used in the output layer for regression tasks. The Adam optimizer is employed to efficiently optimize the model parameters during training.

# DNN model fiting
history=model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_split=0.05, verbose = 'auto')
ChatGPT
In this code snippet, you're fitting the compiled model to the training data. Let's break down the parameters used in the fit() function:

X_train, y_train: These are the training features and target labels, respectively, used to train the model.
epochs: This parameter specifies the number of times the entire dataset will be passed forward and backward through the neural network during training. In this case, you've set it to 100, meaning the model will go through the entire dataset 100 times during training.
validation_split: This parameter determines the fraction of the training data to be used as validation data. In this case, 5% of the training data will be used for validation, and the remaining 95% will be used for training. Validation data is used to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training and helps prevent overfitting.
verbose: This parameter controls the verbosity of the training process. Setting it to 'auto' means the training progress will be shown automatically based on the verbose setting in model.fit(), which can be set to different levels such as 0 (silent), 1 (progress bar), or 2 (one line per epoch).
After fitting the model, the history object contains information about the training process, such as the loss and metrics values at each epoch. This information can be used for further analysis and visualization of the training performance.

fig.update_layout(height=500, width=700, xaxis_title='Epoch', yaxis_title='Mean Squared Error')

fig.show()
This code will create a plot showing the training and validation Mean Squared Error (MSE) over epochs. It's another useful visualization to understand how the model's performance changes during training and validation.

# Analysis or results
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse_nn, mae_nn= model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print('Mean squared error on test data: ', mse_nn)
print('Mean absolute error on test data: ', mae_nn)
print('Accuracy:', r2*100)
ChatGPT
This code segment analyzes the performance of the trained neural network model on the test data. Let's break it down:

Prediction: model.predict(X_test) generates predictions for the test data (X_test). These predictions are stored in y_pred.
Evaluation: model.evaluate(X_test, y_test) evaluates the model's performance on the test data. It computes the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted values (y_pred) and the actual target values (y_test). The calculated MSE is stored in mse_nn and the MAE in mae_nn.
R-squared Score: r2_score(y_test, y_pred) calculates the R-squared score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). This score is stored in r2.
Printing Results: The code then prints out the mean squared error, mean absolute error, and the accuracy (R-squared score) on the test data.
Here's the code with annotations:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Predictions on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation: Mean squared error and mean absolute error
mse_nn, mae_nn = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

# R-squared Score
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Printing Results
print('Mean squared error on test data:', mse_nn)
print('Mean absolute error on test data:', mae_nn)
print('Accuracy (R-squared score) on test data:', r2)
This analysis provides insights into how well the model performs on unseen data, helping to assess its generalization ability.

# prediction / testing
import sklearn
new_data = sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit_transform(([[0.1, 10.0, 5.0, 0, 0.4, 6.0, 50, 6.0, 1, 400, 20, 300, 10]]))
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
print("Predicted house price:", prediction)
ChatGPT
This code segment demonstrates how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data. Let's break it down:

Preprocessing New Data: The new data is preprocessed using the same scaling parameters (mean and standard deviation) as the training data. Here, StandardScaler().fit_transform() scales the new data using the mean and standard deviation calculated during the training phase.
Prediction: The preprocessed new data is passed to the trained model (model.predict(new_data)) to obtain predictions for the target variable (house price). The predicted house price is stored in the variable prediction.
Printing Prediction: Finally, the predicted house price is printed out using print().
Here's the code with annotations:

python
Copy code
import sklearn

# Preprocessing New Data
new_data = sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit_transform([[0.1, 10.0, 5.0, 0, 0.4, 6.0, 50, 6.0, 1, 400, 20, 300, 10]])

# Prediction
prediction = model.predict(new_data)

# Printing Prediction
print("Predicted house price:", prediction)
This code snippet allows you to use your trained model to predict the price of a house given its features. The new data should be preprocessed in the same way as the training data to ensure consistency in scaling
